Hello, everyone! I'm thrilled to share a new project that's been a true labor of love outside of my day job.

Those who know me well know I'm utterly fascinated by technology and absolutely love building things that solve real-world problems. As a Solution Architect for Microsoft Dynamics Applications, I'm fortunate to spend my workdays immersed in exciting projects, implementing software, and solving complex challenges. But even after hours, my brain keeps buzzing, always searching for the next interesting technical puzzle to tackle.

And ... [BiziApps](http://biziapps.org)  was born!

## Why Biziapps Was Born

So what is Biziapps? It's a new application designed to help people in the Microsoft Business Applications industry discover job opportunities.

I began this project by observing a particular challenge in our industry right now. With less demand for skilled professionals compared to the peak few years back, I noticed many in our community were struggling to find relevant roles. And After diving into the job market data to figure out exactly why folks can't find a role, I realized the core issue wasn't a lack of opportunities, but rather the disparate and unnormalized nature of the job data itself.

And you might already know this problem: You  define yourself as a "regular" senior consultant, others might define your role as a "manager" or a "team lead". Some others might define it as an "Architect", but heck. Isn't the Architect a Solution Architect?
Well, maybe.

And this is exactly the problem Biziapps is trying to solve.
Fetch Job data, normalize it, and present it to you based on your real role.

With the problem realized, and the interest in a technical challenge, I asked myself: how could I bring order to this chaos? The answer is algorithms capable of fetching data from various job sources, standardizing it, and making it easily accessible for professionals across the Dynamics 365 and Power Platform ecosystem â€“ from consultants and solution architects to developers and project managers. Across all Business Applications: Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations, Business Central, Power Apps, etc.

## The Journey of Building It

Developing these algorithms and a robust backend was an incredibly rewarding experience. I spent countless weekends experimenting, refining, and testing. Even built my own server!
And after running the system for a few months, I was genuinely excited by the accuracy and relevance of the results. This application is really proving value!

With the backend in a good place, I then began developing the user-facing application, aiming to make it easy for anyone to use. The expierence from other side projects like Plaza helped to get this up and running in almost no time.


## Take a Look and Share Your Thoughts!

Biziapps is currently in beta, and it's something I continue to tinker with during my "endless weekends." I would be super grateful if you could share your thoughts on functionality missing or any obersavtions you made.

For now Biziapps will remain free and early users will get a lifetime free access as a thank you for helping me!
