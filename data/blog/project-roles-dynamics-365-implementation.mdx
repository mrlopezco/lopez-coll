### Introduction

From an organization's perspective, a Dynamics 365 project is likely one of the most extensive undertakings and one of the most critical challenges early on is to assemble the proper team.
Before you can define and recruit your team (either partner lead, or customer lead), it's essential to identify the roles required for the project.
Depending on the specifics of the project, the requirements will vary but in this post I want to provide an overview of the most recurring roles in a Dynamics 365 project.

For the sake of this article, let's assume your project encompasses several Dynamics 365 applications, such as Finance and Operations, Dynamics 365 Sales, and Dynamics 365 Field Service.
For such a large-scale project, you will need multiple teams within the implementation team.

At the highest level, you'll need a Project Management team, which includes the executive sponsors, client engagement managers, project managers, project coordinators, and the enterprise architect.
The enterprise architect is responsible for the overall solution across all Dynamics applications. Within the functional teams, each application typically has its own solution architect.

There would be a Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations solution architect, a Dynamics 365 Sales solution architect, and a Dynamics 365 Field Service solution architect.
These Architects lead within their stream consultants, product owners, key users, and business analysts.

Next, you have the Technical team. Depending on the skill sets of the developers, you can organize them by application or create cross-functional teams.

Finally, there is the Extended team, which includes roles such as test managers, training leads, and change managers.

Below, you'll find detailed descriptions of each role, their responsibilities, and the time commitments required for the project.
