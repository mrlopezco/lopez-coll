## Hi There! <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="waving-hand" />

I'm **Ignacio Lopez Coll**, a seasoned Senior Solution Architect in Microsoft Dynamics (AX 4.0 up to Dynamics 365 Finance &
Supply Chain Management).

Large international project experience including European, North, and South American countries. Strengths include strong
listening skills, comprehension of complex issues, customer issue resolution, and fulfillment of customer’s business
requirements.

Visualizing the customer's success through issue resolution and process improvement are my key priorities and the
motivators that drive me. Ensuring finance consistency through cross-functional business processes is a key specialty of mine.

Lately, my main projects have been the implementation of Dynamics at large scale for Enterprise clients, requiring not only
Finance & Operations but the entire D365 Suite, including products like Sales and Field Service.
